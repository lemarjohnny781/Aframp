## Checklist

<!-- All boxes must be checked before requesting review. -->

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows the project's style and conventions (ESLint passes: `npm run lint`)

- [ ] No secrets, wallet keys, or PII committed to the repository
- [ ] New `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables added to `.env.example` (if applicable)

### Observability

- [ ] New API routes use `captureError` / `log` from `lib/observability`
- [ ] New Stellar SDK calls are wrapped in try/catch forwarding to `captureError`
- [ ] No sensitive data (private keys, mnemonics, tokens) passed to `log.*` or `captureError`

### Security

- [ ] User inputs are validated with Zod (or equivalent) before processing
- [ ] No new server-side secrets are exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
- [ ] Webhook signatures are verified where applicable
- [ ] Rate limiting applied to new public API endpoints (Upstash)

### Accessibility (UI changes only)

- [ ] Interactive elements have accessible labels (`aria-label`, `aria-describedby`)
- [ ] Colour contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for new interactive components

### Documentation

- [ ] Inline code comments added for non-obvious logic
- [ ] README or docs updated if the change affects setup or configuration
